# C-Programs
This repo contains the programs that I created while learning to code in C programming language. You can use these programs as examples to learn various concepts of C programming language. All the programs are well commented for better understanding.

I will also be uploading a pdf copy of the book "The C programming language by dennis ritchie" with highlights of important points once I finish reading it, So stay tuned.
